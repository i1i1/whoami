This is a repo from which my website and my cv can be built. Check it out here: https://i1i1.github.io/whoami

It is built via [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with theme [Anemone](https://github.com/Speyll/anemone) and packaged/build via [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

Unfortunately pdf can't be built from website for now (WIP).
