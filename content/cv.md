## Ivan Rybin

Hello! I’m a software engineer with a solid five-year background in blockchain and backend development.
I’m deeply interested in functional programming, formal methods, and verification, and I have a soft
spot for low-level system development like OS/kernel development.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I enjoy exploring philosophy and engaging in hobbies like smart-home
projects, sports, 3D printing, and occasionally cooking.

Here is a list of tags relevant to me:

`Rust` `Substrate` `Ethereum` `Blockchain` `DevOps` `CI` `CD` `Nix` `NixOS` `Python` `Linux` `C` `Emacs`

## Experience

### [Lumio](https://lumio.io/) @ [pontem.network](pontem.network) -- Senior Rust Developer

*02/2024 - Present*

At Lumio, I’m currently working on an Optimistic Rollup on Ethereum that supports both
Move VM and EVM. My main role is to develop a rollup node, which started as a fork of
[a16z's Magi][magi] rollup node.

I also handle various deployments and CI/CD processes for the project using Nix and
NixOS, including setting up our [attic] cache server.

### [Subspace](https://subspace.network) -- Protocol Engineer

*01/2022 - 07/2023*

At Subspace, I was part of the team developing the Subspace farmer, a component similar
to a miner but for Proof of Storage blockchains. My work involved:

- Implementing the Subspace farmer protocol.
- Profiling and optimizing the performance of the implementation, database, and architecture.

I also worked on different parts of the Substrate stack:

- Optimizing [Substrate telemetry](https://github.com/subspace/substrate-telemetry/) to handle up to 30k nodes on the testnet.
- Contributing to [parity db](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-db).

Additionally, I developed the [subspace-sdk](https://github.com/subspace/subspace-pulsar-sdk) from the ground up, integrating the Subspace substrate node and farmer into a Rust library.

### [Soramitsu](https://soramitsu.co.jp) -- Rust Developer

*02/2021 - 10/2021*

At Soramitsu, my focus was on developing the [Hyperledger Iroha 2](iroha2) blockchain. My responsibilities included:

- Working on all the parts of the blockchain node starting from consensus and smart contract VM ending with networing
- Creating a Python client library
- Managing DevOps, including crafting CI/CD pipelines.
- Researching various blockchain technologies and their implementations.

### [Intropy](https://intropy-tech.ru) -- Middle/Senior Developer

*11/2019 - 02/2021*

I worked on the SmartScales project, aimed at automating food recognition in grocery
stores using microcontrollers. My role included:

- Transitioning Python microservices to a Rust-based monolith using actix-web.
- Developing recognition libraries and their Rust bindings.
- Handling MLOps, including model optimization and deployment.
- Implementing CI/CD and observability practices.

My earlier work history is available upon request.
